The idea of this project was developed when working on my [last project](https://huiminqu.github.io/projects/portfolio-2/), during which I realized the mass of the black hole, which was treated as a constant for a certain system, can actually vary in the accretion system. The innovation of this work is the combination with the lower mass gap problem, and the method based on a observational perspective (Our group also have published simulational work regarding the subject). I have learned so much about the evolution from progenitor to black hole mass, and scientific writing skills.<br><br>

The ultrarelativistic jets triggered by neutrino annihilation processes or Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanisms in stellar-mass black hole (BH) hyperaccretion systems are generally considered to power gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Due to the high accretion rate, the central BHs might grow rapidly on a short timescale, providing a new way to understand "the lower mass gap" problem. In this work, we confine the characteristics of the black hole hyperaccretion system based on the observational GRBs data. Then, We study the analytical model for the evolutive central black hole using different initial BH parameters. By applying the numerical results, we can feasibly compare the growth in mass for different circumstances. The results show that under neutrino annihilation mechanism, the accretion process can enable the remnant black hole to escape the lower mass gap, while under the BZ mechanism, the growth of the black hole is inefficient. With more and more electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations for compact objects, we are looking forward to more creative perspectives about the mechanisms in supernova explosion and black hole evolution, as well as confines of progenitors' distrubution and properties.<br><br>

The paper (author: Huimin Qu, Tong Liu) has been submitted to ApJ.<br>
