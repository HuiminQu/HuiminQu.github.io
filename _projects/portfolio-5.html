<h3>Fast Lightweight Autonomy for UAVs</h3>

"The program focuses on autonomy and not on the flight platform, where “autonomy” includes sensing, perception, planning, and control. Autonomous flight capabilities are being developed and demonstrated using custom payloads on small commercial airframes.

Phase 1 of DARPA’s Fast Lightweight Autonomy (FLA) program concluded in Spring 2017 following a series of obstacle-course flight tests in central Florida. The program conducted Phase 2 flight testing in Georgia in June 2018, where teams demonstrated flight through tight indoor spaces, urban outdoor environments, and cluttered natural scenes."
