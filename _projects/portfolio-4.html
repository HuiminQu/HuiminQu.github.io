<h3>Gesture Controlled Robot Arm</h3>
<p align="justify">
Here's a video of our Gesture Controlled Robotic Arm project. We're using a Leap Motion device on the client side along with our custom designed web application that communicates wirelessly with a 5-DOF  Robotic Arm on the server side. The Robotic Arm was made using 5 BMS 860DMax servos, a laser cut plastic frame and an Arduino Yun microcontroller.<br><br>
