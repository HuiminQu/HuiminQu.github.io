    The accretion processes play as pivotal roles in many problems, such as energy supply, galaxy evolution and elements formation. In the collapsar scenario, the initial mass supply rates can keep the accretion process in the Neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAF) phase, which have very high accretion rates and are in the state of high mass surface density. Therefore, photons are trapped in such an environment with high temperature and density, and only neutrinos can escape from the disk surface to dissipate the viscous heating energy. <br><br>
    Our work is based on theories including neutrino physics, thermodynamics and galaxy evolution. We study the NDAFs with outflows and briefly explore their nucleosynthesis conditions by computation. Focusing on the 56 Ni synthesis, we estimate the contribution of NDAFs and compare it with that of core-collaspe supernovae, showing that NDAFs with outflows can be a second nucleosynthesis factory in core-collaspe supernovae. In fact, we can explain the core-collaspe supernovae lightcurves well by considering this contribution and should not neglect it in the lightcurves, especially in SN-GRB events. Another critical conclusion is that 56 Ni products depend weakly on progenitor masses. Besides, we discuss the impact of nucleosynthesis of NDAFs on chemical evolution of galaxies.<br><br>
