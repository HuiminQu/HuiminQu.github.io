    For the stellar-mass black holes in hyperaccretion, such as Neutrino-dominated accretion flows(NDAF), high accretion rate will trigger the violent evolution of BHâ€™s characteristics. Since NDAF is a plausible central engine model of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), whose energy is powered via neutrino annihilation, we can confine the characteristics based on the observational GRBs data. We study the analytical model for the evolutive central engine of GRBs using different initial BH parameters. By applying the numerical results, we
can feasibly compare the growth in mass for different circumstances. The result will contribute to solving the mass gap problem for compact objects. With more and more electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations for compact objects, we are looking forward to more creative perspectives about the mechanisms in supernova explosion and black hole evolution, as well as confines of progenitors' distrubution and properties.<br><br>

    The paper is in preparation now.<br>
