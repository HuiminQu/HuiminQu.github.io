    The intrinsic structures of galaxies can be revealed by tracing molecules in dynamical systems and metal abundances. Simulations, such as IllustrisTNG, provide us with the possibility to study the correlations between different statistical parameters of galaxies, as well as the information about their particles and merger trees. By applying our population-orbit superposition models, we aim to analyze the formation history of the inner halo of our galaxy.<br><br>
