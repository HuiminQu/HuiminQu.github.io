I was invited to speak at the NVIDIA GPU Technology Conference for at their
NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Day. Here is a video from the talk. The talk
is mainly centered around the use of the NVIDIA Jetson platform on our
quadrotors and some information regarding the autonomous UAV software stack that was designed
at our lab.
