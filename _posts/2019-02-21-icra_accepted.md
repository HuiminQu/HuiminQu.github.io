Two papers that I was a part of:

## 1. The Open Vision Computer: An Integrated Sensing and Compute System for Mobile Robots

[Paper (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07674)

#### Abstract

In this paper we describe the Open Vision Computer (OVC) which was designed to support high speed, vision guided autonomous drone flight. In particular our aim was to develop a system that would be suitable for relatively small-scale flying platforms where size, weight, power consumption and computational performance were all important considerations. This manuscript describes the primary features of our OVC system and explains how they are used to support fully autonomous indoor and outdoor exploration and navigation operations on our Falcon 250 quadrotor platform.

## 2. Real Time Dense Depth Estimation by Fusing Stereo with Sparse Depth Measurements

[Paper (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07677)

#### Abstract
We present an approach to depth estimation that fuses information from a stereo pair with sparse range measurements derived from a LIDAR sensor or a range camera. The goal of this work is to exploit the complementary strengths of the two sensor modalities, the accurate but sparse range measurements and the ambiguous but dense stereo information. These two sources are effectively and efficiently fused by combining ideas from anisotropic diffusion and semi-global matching.

We evaluate our approach on the KITTI 2015 and Middlebury 2014 datasets, using randomly sampled ground truth range measurements as our sparse depth input. We achieve significant performance improvements with a small fraction of range measurements on both datasets. We also provide qualitative results from our platform using the PMDTec Monstar sensor. Our entire pipeline runs on an NVIDIA TX-2 platform at 5Hz on 1280x1024 stereo images with 128 disparity levels.

Have been accepted to the "IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2019" (ICRA 2019). I will be attending to present this work, so feel free to reach out to me if you're there.
