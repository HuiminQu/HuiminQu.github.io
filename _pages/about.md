I am Huimin Qu(瞿惠敏), a third-year undergraduate student at [Department of Astronomy, Xiamen University](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm).

I came to love starry sky at a very young age, and decided to do astronomy research at high school. Now as a junoir, I possess a solid foundation in physics, mathematics, and programming, and have accumulated valuable research experience. My research interest is mainly on the theoretical part in astronomy, ranging from black hole physics to galaxies. I hold great interest in cosmology (nature of dark matter, dark energy survey, epoch of reionization, and cosmic structure), black hole physics, and standard model. Furthermore, I acquire a great programming and experimental experience, and I am eager to learn more to be a good astronomy researcher.

I am currently working on a thesis with [Prof. Tong Liu](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/info/1074/1845.htm), which is on the growths of stellar-mass black holes.
