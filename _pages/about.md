Hi, I am Huimin Qu (瞿惠敏), a Ph.D. candidate at the Sydney Institute for Astronomy (SIfA), the University of Sydney.  
My research focuses on reconstructing strong gravitational lens systems within a Bayesian inference framework, with an emphasis on modeling multi-band imaging and joint lensing–kinematics data.  

I am a member of the [AGEL](https://sites.google.com/view/agelsurvey/research/hubble-images?authuser=0) collaboration, which spectroscopically confirms a diverse sample of gravitational lenses and provides high-resolution imaging for the study of galaxy structure and evolution.

More broadly, I am motivated by developing and applying scalable inference techniques and statistical methodologies to extract physical information from complex astronomical data, with applications to galaxy evolution, cosmology, and time-domain astronomy.

Recent work includes [the multi-band reconstruction of 16 strong lens systems using PISCO data](../posts/HuiminQu_Paper1.pdf).

My CV can be found [here](../posts/HuiminQu_CV.pdf).
