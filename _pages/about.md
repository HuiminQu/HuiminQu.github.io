I am Huimin Qu (瞿惠敏), a fourth-year undergraduate student at [Department of Astronomy, Xiamen University](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/).

I came to love the starry sky at a very young age, and decided to do the astronomy research at high school. My research interest is mainly on the theoretical part in astronomy, and I have accumulated valuable research experience ranging from black hole accretion disk to galaxy dynamics. I hold great interest in cosmology (nature of dark matter, dark energy survey, epoch of reionization, and cosmic structure), black hole physics, and standard model. The curiosity about nature, openess to new ideas, and strong wish to uncover intrinsic relations, all of these have lead me to go on the path of studying astronomy.

I am currently studying the turn-around radius using the  relativistic cosmological simulation, [gevolution](https://github.com/gevolution-code/), with [Prof. David F. Mota](http://www.mn.uio.no/astro/english/people/aca/mota/) and [Dr. Farbod Hassani](https://www.mn.uio.no/astro/english/people/aca/hassanif/index.html). I also have studied the stellar-mass black hole hyperaccretion system center of gamma-ray bursts for two years, in collaboration with [Prof. Tong Liu](https://astro.xmu.edu.cn/info/1036/1295_1.htm). You can find my past researches in [Projects](https://huiminqu.github.io/projects/).
