Homography estimation between multiple aerial images can provide relative pose
estimation for collaborative autonomous exploration and monitoring. The usage on
a robotic system requires a fast and robust homography estimation algorithm. In
this letter, we propose an unsupervised learning algorithm that trains a deep
convolutional neural network to estimate planar homographies. We compare the
proposed algorithm to traditional-feature-based and direct methods, as well as a
corresponding supervised learning algorithm. Our empirical results demonstrate
that compared to traditional approaches, the unsupervised algorithm achieves
faster inference speed, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy and
robustness to illumination variation. In addition, our unsupervised method has
superior adaptability and performance compared to the corresponding supervised
deep learning method. Our image dataset and a Tensorflow implementation of our
work are available at
