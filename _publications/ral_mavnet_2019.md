Real-time semantic image segmentation on platforms subject to size, weight, and power constraints is a key area of interest for air surveillance and inspection. In this letter, we propose MAVNet: a small, light-weight, deep neural network for real-time semantic segmentation on micro aerial vehicles (MAVs). MAVNet, inspired by ERFNet [E. Romera, J. M. lvarez, L. M. Bergasa, and R. Arroyo, “ErfNet: Efficient residual factorized convnet for real-time semantic segmentation,” IEEE Trans. Intell. Transp. Syst. , vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 263–272, Jan. 2018.], features 400 times fewer parameters and achieves comparable performance with some reference models in empirical experiments. Additionally, we provide two novel datasets that represent challenges in semantic segmentation for real-time MAV tracking and infrastructure inspection tasks and verify MAVNet on these datasets. Our algorithm and datasets are made publicly available.
